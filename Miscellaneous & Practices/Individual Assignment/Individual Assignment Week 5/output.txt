I'm at a pnhpoaye tyring to clal hmoe 
All of my cgahne I spent on you 
Whree hvae the tmeis gnoe? 
Bbay, it's all wnrog 
Werhe are the palns we made for two? 
Yaeh, I, I konw i'ts hrad to remmbeer 
The pploee we used to be 
I'ts even haerdr to pctriue 
That yru'oe not hree next to me 
You say i'ts too ltae to mkae it 
But is it too ltae to try? 
And in our time that you wtsaed 
All of our beigrds burned down 
I've wtased my nhtgis 
You terund out the lhgits 
Now I'm pazleayrd 
Siltl stuck in taht tmie, when we cllead it love 
But eevn the sun sets in paisarde 
I'm at a paohnpye, tniyrg to clal home 
All of my cganhe I spent on you 
Wrhee hvae the tmies gnoe? 
Bbay, it's all wrnog 
Wrhee are the plans we made for two? 
If "phapy ever artfe" did eisxt

All those fariy tales are flul of shit 
One more fkuincg lvoe snog, I'll be scik, oh 
You tunred yuor back on toorrmow 
'sauCe you fogort yesdratey 
I gave you my lvoe to boorrw 
But you just gave it away 
You cna't ecxept me to be fine 
I don't epexct you to crae 
I know Iv'e siad it brfoee 
But all of our bidgers bnured dwon 
I've wetsad my nigths 
You truend out the ltihgs 
Now I'm prazeayld 
Siltl sutck in taht tmie 
When we claeld it love 
But eevn the sun sets in psaaride 
I'm at a poypnahe tiryng to call home 
All of my cnhgae I spent on you 
Whree have the teims gnoe? 
Baby, it's all wrong 
Whree are the palns we made for two? 
If "apphy ever afetr" did esixt

And all thsoe fairy tlaes are full of shit 
One more fnuckig lvoe song, I'll be sick

And all of my cars strat wtih a psuh of a btotun 
Tllineg me the caenhcs I blew up or wavether you call it
