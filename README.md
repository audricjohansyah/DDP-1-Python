# Programming Foundations 1 - Python
This repository contains my projects and assignments completed during the "Programming Foundations 1" course, part of my first semester in the Information Systems program at Universitas Indonesia.

The course focuses on foundational programming concepts using Python, covering topics such as:

- Variables and Data Types
- Loops and Conditionals
- Functions and Modules
- Error Handling
- Basic Data Structures
- Basic File I/O Operations
- GUI
- Classes

These projects demonstrate the core principles of programming and problem-solving using Python.
